# DormitoryComplexManagementSystem
Complex system which divided in few parts:
 - Dormitory RESTful API service created using Java Spring Framework (Spring Security, Spring Data Jpa, PostgreSQL, JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication) - for exposing data from database in restful way.
 - Dormitory WebClient service created using Java Spring Framework (Spring WebFlux) - Client for retrieving data from RESTful API. -- NOT IMPLEMENTED
 - Dormitory Desktop Application - desktop application created using Java, JavaFX and Spring Framework for DI (Dependency Injection) and other useful features. Also using WebClient for retrieving data to display and manage. -- NOT IMPLEMENTED
 - Dormitory Web Application - web application using Java Spring Framework(Spring Web) -- NOT IMPLEMENTED
In this poject I'm also using such technologies as Lombok, JUnit, slf4j. For future task there is dividing RESTful API service to microservices architecture.
